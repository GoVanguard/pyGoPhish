# pyGoPhish

pyGoPhish is a GoVanguard microservices web application that automates phishing reconnaissance and message delivery. Special thanks to Shane Scott and Travis DeForge at GoVanguard. Additional thanks to Jason Johnston at Microsoft. Without the inspiration provided by Travis’ experience with managing phishing campaigns, Shane’s extensive experience with application design and testing, and the continued support provided by Microsoft’s talented team in the Microsoft Graph Developer Experience program; the SAML integration of pyGoPhish as a registered private web application within AKS would not have been possible.
